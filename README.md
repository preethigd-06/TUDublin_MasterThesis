Abstract

The increased usage of smartphones for daily activities has created a huge demand and
opportunities in the field of ubiquitous computing to provide personalized services and
support to the user. In this aspect, Sensor-Based Human Activity Recognition (HAR)
has seen an immense growth in the last decade playing a major role in the field of
pervasive computing by detecting the activity performed by the user. Thus, accurate
prediction of user activity can be valuable input to several applications like health
monitoring systems, wellness and fit tracking, emergency communication systems etc.,
Thus, the current research performs Human Activity Recognition using a Particle
Swarm Optimization (PSO) based Convolutional Neural Network which converges
faster and searches the best CNN architecture. Using PSO for the training process
intends to optimize the results of the solution vectors on CNN which in turn improve
the classification accuracy to reach the quality performance compared to the stateof-
the-art designs. The study investigates the performances PSO-CNN algorithm and
compared with that of classical machine leaning algorithms and deep learning algorithms.
The experiment results showed that the PSO-CNN algorithm was able to
achieve the performance almost equal to the state-of-the-art designs with a accuracy
of 93.64%. Among machine learning algorithms, Support Vector machine found to
be best classifer with accuracy of 95.05% and a Deep CNN model achieved 92.64%
accuracy score.
